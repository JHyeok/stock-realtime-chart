# Real-Time Stock Chart (with ChatGPT)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It visualizes real-time stock price changes with a live chart and search functionality.

> 💡 This project was created collaboratively with [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com). I am a backend developer from South Korea with very little experience in frontend development, especially with Next.js. ChatGPT helped me design, structure, and implement the entire frontend step by step.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
